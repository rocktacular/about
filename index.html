        Hey, I'm Colin. I'm based in Austin, TX, USA, although sometimes I work
        from other places.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a front-end engineer and tech lead, and I've developed lots of great
        apps at my last agency job for both huge companies and startups (<a
          href="agency-projects.html"
          >here's a summary</a
        >).

      <p><em>My Development Values</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration</strong> across functional departments to build
          the best experience possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Planning & Documentation</strong> so everyone knows what to do
          and how to do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Readability & Consistency</strong> so teammates can
          understand what we did and build on it quickly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <p>
        When I'm not leading software projects, I enjoy physical activities like
        bouldering and calisthenics. I love the ocean, so I travel to windsurf,
        scuba, and free-dive. And when I just want a quiet morning with tea, I
        do crosswords and logic puzzles.
